W. Edwards Deming was an adviser, consultant, author, and teacher to some of the most influential businessmen, corporations, and scientific pioneers of business process re-engineering. He has been described as a national folk hero in Japan, where he was directly responsible for inspiring and guiding the spectacular rise of Japanese industry after World War II, as well as the original management science guru, and founder of the third wave of the Industrial Revolution.
